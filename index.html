                <p> I have been a stay at home mom for the past year and a half. Before that, I taught English as a
                    Second
                    Language in the public school system for fourteen years. I have taught a wide range of grades, from
                    pre-K to
                    college level. I enjoyed what I did, however, it became unfulling and I knew that it was my time to
                    step away from the classroom. </p>

                <p> I have varied interests. I love to read, as well as play video games with my family. Speaking of
                    family, I
                    have two teenage daughters,
                    who are both in middle school. They keep me on my toes! I have been married for twenty and half
                    years. My
                    husband is an asset engineer at
                    the local utility company. We enjoy spending time together. We also love to travel and take family
                    holidays.
                    We have planned a trip to Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, for this summer. We are excited.
                </p>

                <p>I chose coding because of the opportunities it provides. It allows me to be creative and to
                    create a "new world".It allows for collaboration. I know it will be challenging, but to be able to
                    see "real
                    world" connections
                    fascinates me.</p>

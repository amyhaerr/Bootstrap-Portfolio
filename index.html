            <p> I have been a stay at home mom for the past year and a half. Before that, I taught English as a Second Language 
                in the public school system for fourteen years. I have taught a wide range of grades, from pre-K to college level. I enjoyed what I
            did, however, it became unfulling and I knew that it was my time to step away from the classroom. </p>

            <p>I have varied interests. I love to read, as well as play video games with my family. Speaking of family, I have two teenage daughters,
                who are both in middle school. They keep me on my toes! I have been married for twenty and half years. My husband is an asset engineer at 
                the local utility company. We enjoy spending time together. We also love to travel and take family holidays. We have planned a trip to 
                Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, for this summer. We are excited.</p>

            <p>I chose coding because of the opportunities it provides. It allows me to be creative and to 
                create a "new world".It allows for collaboration. I know it will be challenging, but to be able to see "real world" connections 
                fascinates me.</p>
